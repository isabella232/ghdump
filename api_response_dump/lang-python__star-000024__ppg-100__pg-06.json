automata-processing engines are traditionally evaluated using a limited set of regular expression rulesets. While regular expression rulesets are valid real-world examples of use cases for automata processing, they represent a small proportion of all use  cases for automata-based computing. With the recent availability of architectures and software frameworks for automata processing, many new applications have been found to benefit from automata processing. These show a wide variety of characteristics that differ from prior, popular regular-expression benchmarks, and these should be considered when designing new systems for automata processing. This paper presents ANMLZoo, a benchmark repository for automata-based applications as well as automata engines for both von-Neumann and reconfigurable data flow architectures.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2016-10-08T02:31:42Z","pushed_at":"2018-06-27T16:31:27Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T17:41:10Z","html_url":"https://github.com/jackwadden/ANMLZoo","clone_url":"https://github.com/jackwadden/ANMLZoo.git","git_url":"git://github.com/jackwadden/ANMLZoo.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:jackwadden/ANMLZoo.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/jackwadden/ANMLZoo","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":15,"open_issues_count":5,"stargazers_count":24,"watchers_count":24,"size":103506,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jackwadden/ANMLZoo/teams"},{"id":238793761,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzg3OTM3NjE=","owner":{"login":"Abhi141188","id":55540924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTQwOTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/55540924?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/Abhi141188","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Abhi141188/subscriptions"},"name":"MarketingAnalyticsWithPython","full_name":"Abhi141188/MarketingAnalyticsWithPython","description":"Marketing
