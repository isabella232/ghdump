present MocapNET, an ensemble of SNN encoders that estimates the 3D human body pose based on 2D joint estimations extracted from monocular RGB images. MocapNET provides BVH file output which can be rendered in real-time or imported without any additional processing in most popular 3D animation software. The proposed architecture achieves 3D human pose estimations at state of the art rates of 400Hz using only CPU processing.","homepage":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH5e-KMBvM0","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2019-07-05T11:13:29Z","pushed_at":"2020-06-25T09:44:49Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T03:59:05Z","html_url":"https://github.com/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET","clone_url":"https://github.com/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET.git","git_url":"git://github.com/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET","language":"C++","fork":false,"forks_count":18,"open_issues_count":5,"stargazers_count":83,"watchers_count":83,"size":9332,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"topics":["2d-to-3d","3d-animation","3d-pose-estimation","bvh","bvh-format","computer-vision","demo","ensemble","gesture-recognition","mocap","neural-network","pose-estimation","real-time","rgb-images","tensorflow","webcam"],"archived":false,"disabled":false,"license":{"key":"other","name":"Other","spdx_id":"NOASSERTION"},"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FORTH-ModelBasedTracker/MocapNET/teams"},{"id":65666175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTY2NjE3NQ==","owner":{"login":"morbac","id":10232771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjMyNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/10232771?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/morbac","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/morbac","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morb
