propose a model to analyze sentiment of online stock forum and use the information to predict stock volatility in the Chinese market. By generating a sentimental dictionary, we analyze the sentimental tendencies of each post as sentiment indicators. Such sentimental information will be fused with market data for prediction based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We manually labeled the sentiment of forum post and make the data public available for research. Empirical evidence shows that 8 of the 10 stocks perform better with sentimental indicators.","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2016-11-13T03:54:54Z","pushed_at":"2017-06-04T04:57:23Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T06:36:02Z","html_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction","clone_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction.git","git_url":"git://github.com/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":12,"open_issues_count":0,"stargazers_count":49,"watchers_count":49,"size":26773,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/EMM-for-stock-prediction/teams"},{"id":144514241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDQ1MTQyNDE=","owner":{"login":"reecetech","id":39549693,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM5NTQ5Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/39549693?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/reecetech","gravatar_id":"","type":"Organization","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/reecetech","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reecetech/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reecetech/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reecetech/followers","gists_url":"htt
