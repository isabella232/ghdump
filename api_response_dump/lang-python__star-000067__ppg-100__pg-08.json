样本更是让模型脆弱。 本人可以解决有关缠论的任何问题。凡使用缠论亏钱的任何人的任何次交易，本人都可以明确在当下，不知道后续走势的情况下指出其错误所在，从而在当时避免错误。如果交易能亏损很多，用亏损的钱的十分之一学习到能避免重复的亏损的问题，大大的值得了。      缠论的难点在于，同级别分解如何分解，同级别分解的多义性，背驰力度的计算，小转大卖点的处理，跳空等极端走势对走势划分的影响，卖点比买点级别小的把握，中枢震荡的操作，如何规避T+1,等等。","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2018-12-09T17:34:09Z","pushed_at":"2020-07-08T01:40:25Z","updated_at":"2020-07-09T14:03:24Z","html_url":"https://github.com/tomcat123a/-chanlun","clone_url":"https://github.com/tomcat123a/-chanlun.git","git_url":"git://github.com/tomcat123a/-chanlun.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:tomcat123a/-chanlun.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/tomcat123a/-chanlun","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":56,"open_issues_count":1,"stargazers_count":68,"watchers_count":68,"size":39682,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomcat123a/-chanlun/teams"},{"id":256972479,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTY5NzI0Nzk=","owner":{"login":"sibeiyang","id":62798947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzk4OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/62798947?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/sibeiyang","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sibeiyang/subscriptions"},"name":"sgmn","full_name":"sibeiyang/sgmn","description":"Graph-Structured
