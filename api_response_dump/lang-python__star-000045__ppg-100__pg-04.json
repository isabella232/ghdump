an approach for object detection in an image with sliding window. The repository contains three files, make_data.py reads the image in gray scale and converts the image into a numpy array. The labels are also appended based on the file name. In this case, if the file name starts with \"trn\", then 1 is appended else 0. Finally, all the images and labels are saved into .npy file. The test-model-1.py file loads the images and converts the labels into two categories as we are doing binary classification of images. The model is built using keras with theano as backend. In this case, the best training accuracy was 80% since the data was just 500 images and the testing accuracy was 67%","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2016-09-26T02:49:03Z","pushed_at":"2019-08-05T19:20:08Z","updated_at":"2020-06-03T09:26:20Z","html_url":"https://github.com/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window","clone_url":"https://github.com/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window.git","git_url":"git://github.com/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":26,"open_issues_count":1,"stargazers_count":45,"watchers_count":45,"size":1959,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shreyas0906/Object-detection-with-deep-learning-and-sliding-window/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.
