realistic image generation using deep neural networks has become a hot topic in machine learning and computer vision. Such an image can be generated at pixel level by learning from a large collection of images. Learning to generate colorful cartoon images from black-and-white sketches is not only an interesting research problem, but also a useful application in digital entertainment. In this paper, we investigate the sketch-to-image synthesis problem by using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN). We propose a model called auto-painter which can automatically generate compatible colors given a sketch. Wasserstein distance is used in training cGAN to overcome model collapse and enable the model converged much better. The new model is not only capable of painting hand-draw sketch with compatible colors, but also allowing users to indicate preferred colors. Experimental results on different sketch datasets show that the auto-painter performs better than other existing image-to-image methods.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2017-11-14T12:26:56Z","pushed_at":"2020-01-06T05:43:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T06:34:03Z","html_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter","clone_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter.git","git_url":"git://github.com/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:irfanICMLL/Auto_painter.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":13,"open_issues_count":3,"stargazers_count":72,"watchers_count":72,"size":11984,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/irfanICMLL/Auto_painter/teams"},{"id":239786398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk3ODYzOTg=","owner":{"login":"xgnit","id":13747985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQ3OTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13747985?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/xgnit","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xgnit/subscriptions"},"name":"evolutionary-reinforcement-neural-network-autonomous-car","full_name":"xgnit/evolutionary-reinforcement-neural-network-autonomous-car","descri
