project documents my adventures in learning how to wire up my home for wireless power monitoring. I live in a rented apartment so I don't have hacking-access to a meter or breaker panel. Since I'm still very interested in measuring my power usage on a long term basis, I built wireless outlet reporters. Building your own power monitor isn't too tough and can save money but I'm not a fan of sticking my fingers into 120V power. Instead, I'll used the existing Kill-a-watt power monitor, which works great and is available at my local hardware store.","homepage":"http://www.ladyada.net/make/tweetawatt/","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2010-05-08T00:21:09Z","pushed_at":"2010-05-15T22:55:04Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T01:47:07Z","html_url":"https://github.com/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt","clone_url":"https://github.com/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt.git","git_url":"git://github.com/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":17,"open_issues_count":1,"stargazers_count":32,"watchers_count":32,"size":105,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/adafruit/Tweet-a-Watt/teams"},{"id":28595611,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU5NTYxMQ==","owner":{"login":"yiyang-gt","id":3648575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3648575?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/yiyang-gt","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yiyang-gt/subscriptions"},"name":"feat2vec","full_name":"yiyang-gt/feat2vec","description":"Code
