目前只实现了前台的功能，主要有登录，注册，商品展示，购物车等模块。为了便于此项目日后的完善和扩展， 我采用了前后端分离的架构设计。前端主要使用AngularJS，ui-router构建的单页web应用， 通过使用指令，服务，模板，控制器完成前端的MVC分层，各个模板页面的效果实现则使用了基本的HTML，CSS3等技术， 结合JS完成页面的基本交互效果。由于没有实现数据库和后台模块等功能， 项目的测试数据我采用的是JSON格式的数据文件，通过AJax请求完成整个前台功能的数据交互， 后期再考虑实现一个后台管理系统及数据库系统，还有前端页面资源的异步加载及优化。","default_branch":"gh-pages","created_at":"2016-08-14T06:55:48Z","pushed_at":"2016-08-19T03:15:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-28T02:21:49Z","html_url":"https://github.com/weboey/XiaoMiStore","clone_url":"https://github.com/weboey/XiaoMiStore.git","git_url":"git://github.com/weboey/XiaoMiStore.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:weboey/XiaoMiStore.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/weboey/XiaoMiStore","language":"JavaScript","fork":false,"forks_count":78,"open_issues_count":5,"stargazers_count":175,"watchers_count":175,"size":6097,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":true,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/weboey/XiaoMiStore/teams"},{"id":24951312,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDk1MTMxMg==","owner":{"login":"naholyr","id":214067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDA2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/214067?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/naholyr","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naholyr/subscriptions"},"name":"json-server-gui","full_name":"naholyr/json-server-gui","description":"GUI
