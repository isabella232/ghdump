is an embedded library written in C++ that provides the foundation for implementing an NMRA DCC command station. CmdrArduino presents classes and methods for, among other things, setting a locomotive’s speed, activating functions, switching turnouts, and programming DCC decoders. CmdrArduino translates these commands into DCC packets. The packets are carefully prioritzed, and CmdrArduino keeps track of packets that require repeating in the background. An interrupt service routine attached to TIMER1 (AVR) or MCPWM0 (ARM) takes these packets and injects the highest priority packet into the precision DCC waveform. This signal is suitable for amplification with your favorite booster/power station (I like RAILbooster). Please note that the Arduino outputs are not themselves capable of driving trains directly.   Currently, CmdrArduino supports Arduino (including the Railstars Io;duino), with ARM support (for LPC17xx processors) actively being added, making the library name something of a misnomer.","homepage":"http://railstars.com/software/cmdrarduino","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2010-12-18T13:49:44Z","pushed_at":"2018-07-15T01:25:26Z","updated_at":"2020-05-18T18:10:51Z","html_url":"https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino","clone_url":"https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino.git","git_url":"git://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:Railstars/CmdrArduino.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/Railstars/CmdrArduino","language":"C++","fork":false,"forks_count":17,"open_issues_count":17,"stargazers_count":37,"watchers_count":37,"size":370,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":false,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Railstars/CmdrArduino/teams"},{"id":95338575,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTMzODU3NQ==","owner":{"login":"ToadKing","id":1023440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1023440?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/ToadKing","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadKing/subscriptions"},"name":"switch-pro-x","full_name":"ToadKing/switch-pro-x","description":"A
