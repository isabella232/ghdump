The main research topics are Auto-Encoders in relation to the representation learning, the statistical machine learning for energy-based models, adversarial generation networks(GANs), Deep Reinforcement Learning such as Deep Q-Networks, semi-supervised learning, and neural network language model for natural language processing.","homepage":"https://accel-brain.co.jp","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2017-09-15T23:37:39Z","pushed_at":"2020-07-09T13:42:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T07:08:51Z","html_url":"https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code","clone_url":"https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code.git","git_url":"git://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:accel-brain/accel-brain-code.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/accel-brain/accel-brain-code","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":40,"open_issues_count":2,"stargazers_count":100,"watchers_count":100,"size":72188,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"topics":["auto-encoder","automatic-summarization","combinatorial-optimization","convolutional-autoencoder","deconvolution","deep-learning","deep-q-network","deep-reinforcement-learning","energy-based-model","generative-adversarial-network","lstm","multi-agent-reinforcement-learning","q-learning","quantum-annealing","quantum-monte-carlo","reinforcement-learning","restricted-boltzmann-machine","semi-supervised-learning","simulated-annealing","transfer-learning"],"archived":false,"disabled":false,"license":{"key":"gpl-2.0","name":"GNU
