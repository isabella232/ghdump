is not the first and last pandemic. Currently, the information about the pandemic is highly fragmented, especially at the local level. Whereas one can find global information and trackers, it is difficult to find information that is relevant to your community. Furthermore, it is difficult for organizations, funders, companies, volunteers and local leaders to coordinate responses. This puts humanity and local communities at risk. FightPandemics was born to make communities more resilient to pandemics by facilitating access to information and coordinated
