image helper is bloated and the performance impact is quite significant. \nSome of the complexity can also be removed because the gain is not that significant (example: the hash part of the image url).\n\nI would like to be able to use a replacement with the following features:\n- lightweight\n- support for gd and imagemagick\n- has nicer image paths\n\nOptional:\n- use a queueing system for the resize job\n\nIf others are interested we can spec this out further.\n\nUpdate by
