is a big smash up of a lot of various tools I have made in the past along with some new ones. It includes a array of tools for helping with pentesting and messing around on the net. Currently only have installer files made for Ubuntu \u0026 Debian systems, but if you know what you're doing you can easily read them and get what you need to get all the dependencies installed on your own.  I made a quick basic demonstration video you to give a general overview of what it has included, you can watch it here: http://youtu.be/z9rq1SBIYI0  Here is another short video to show how the Dorker piece works: http://youtu.be/43aphr0QRng  It's a bit of a constant work in progress but will be posting updates from time to time as I add more stuff and get them stabilized and working properly without much issue. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions just let me know.
