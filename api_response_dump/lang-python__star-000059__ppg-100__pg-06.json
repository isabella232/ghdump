Conversational Search is the next logic step in the journey to generate intelligent and useful AI. To understand what this may mean, researchers have voiced a continuous desire to study how people currently converse with search engines. Traditionally, the desire to produce such a comprehensive dataset has been limited because those who have this data (Search Engines) have a responsibility to their users to maintain their privacy and cannot share the data publicly in a way that upholds the trusts users have in the Search Engines. Given these two powerful forces we believe we have a dataset and paradigm that meets both sets of needs: A artificial public dataset that approximates the true data and an ability to evaluate model performance on the real user behavior. What this means is we released a public dataset which is generated by creating artificial sessions using embedding similarity and will test on the original data. To say this again: we are not releasing any private user data but are releasing what we believe to be a good representation of true user interactions.","homepage":"https://microsoft.github.io/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search/","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2019-05-15T18:45:55Z","pushed_at":"2019-10-22T21:31:20Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T10:44:23Z","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search","clone_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search.git","git_url":"git://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:microsoft/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Conversational-Search","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":7,"open_issues_count":0,"stargazers_count":60,"watchers_count":60,"size":21,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"license":{"key":"mit","name":"MIT
