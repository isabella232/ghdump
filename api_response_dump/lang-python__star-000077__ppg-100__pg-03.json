These python scripts have been created to fuzz wierd combinations:      URL Escape Characters     HTML Escape Characters     Binary Characters  These scripts were created during an assessment, while trying to bypass a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in order to exploit a XSS vulnerability. Differnt webservers and browsers interpret URL and strange characters differently which could lead to the bypassing of security controls.
