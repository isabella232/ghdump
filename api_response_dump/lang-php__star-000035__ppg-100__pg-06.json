Blank theme is a blank responsive theme for WordPress, with semantic HTML5 code and a very minimal CSS styling. This is not a naked or barebone theme, but a clean starting boilerplate for a more complex theme development. It makes development of complex themes much easier. Most of the necessary styles that don't matter much are provided, such as comments, forms, and regular styling of common elements such as headings, image alignments, etc... However, the rest of the layout has a very minimal styling, so you could start developing your own theme.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2014-02-20T10:24:24Z","pushed_at":"2017-05-29T23:16:42Z","updated_at":"2020-03-31T19:26:43Z","html_url":"https://github.com/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme","clone_url":"https://github.com/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme.git","git_url":"git://github.com/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:bigemployee/BigBlankTheme.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme","language":"PHP","fork":false,"forks_count":12,"open_issues_count":4,"stargazers_count":36,"watchers_count":36,"size":7275,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"license":{"key":"other","name":"Other","spdx_id":"NOASSERTION"},"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigemployee/BigBlankTheme/teams"},{"id":4847383,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODQ3Mzgz","owner":{"login":"kenjis","id":87955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/87955?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/kenjis","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/subscriptions"},"name":"fue
