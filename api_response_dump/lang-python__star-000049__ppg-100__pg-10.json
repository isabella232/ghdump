之后得到目标物体所在场景环境的三维信息，最终实现非接触条件下测距，简单便捷。本次毕业设计主要内容为研究 基于双目立体视觉平台上的图像匹配以及目标物体的距离测量技术，图像特征提取部分研究了 SIFT 算法和 SURF 算 法，特征匹配部分研究了 BF 法和 FLANN 法，距离测量研究主要通过视差深度的计算，结合视觉坐标系的转换实现 三维位置的定位与测量。结合维视双目立体视觉测量平台 MV-VS220，通过 Python+OpenCV 设计实现一个具备图像 采集、图像匹配以及距离测量等功能的原型演示系统。系统可实现对关键环节的过程与结果的演示，以及不同算法的 性能比较。系统测试表明，所开发的原型演示系统从界面、功能与性能方面均达到了设计的要求。","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2019-10-25T07:46:32Z","pushed_at":"2019-10-27T14:53:26Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T15:19:27Z","html_url":"https://github.com/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision","clone_url":"https://github.com/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision.git","git_url":"git://github.com/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":29,"open_issues_count":1,"stargazers_count":50,"watchers_count":50,"size":96492,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng/Image-matching-and-ranging-based-on-binocular-stereo-vision/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cuirongcheng

is formed in human body by abnormal cell multiplication in the tissue. Early detection of tumors and classifying them to Benign and malignant tumours is important in order to prevent its further growth. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a medical imaging technique used by radiologists to study and analyse medical images. Doing critical analysis manually can create unnecessary delay and also the accuracy for the same will be very less due to human errors. The main objective of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to make systems capable enough to perform such critical analysis faster with higher accuracy and efficiency levels. This research work is been done on te existing architecture of convolution neural network which can identify the tumour from MRI image. The Convolution Neural Network was implemented using Keras and TensorFlow, accelerated by NVIDIA Tesla K40 GPU. Using REMBRANDT as the dataset for implementation, the Classification accuracy accuired for AlexNet and ZFNet are 63.56% and 84.42% respectively.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2017-12-18T06:37:33Z","pushed_at":"2017-12-18T08:16:18Z","updated_at":"2020-07-06T14:24:42Z","html_url":"https://github.com/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning","clone_url":"https://github.com/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning.git","git_url":"git://github.com/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":40,"open_issues_count":4,"stargazers_count":50,"watchers_count":50,"size":17,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/21Vipin/Medical-Image-Classification-using-deep-learning/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.
