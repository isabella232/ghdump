Shared Host Integrated Password System (SHIPS) is a solution to provide unique and rotated local super user or administrator passwords for environments where it is not possible or not appropriate to disable these local accounts. Clients may be configured to rotate passwords automatically. Stored passwords can be retrieved by desktop support personnel as required, or updated when a password has to be manually changed in the course of system maintenance. By having unique passwords on each machine and logging of password retrievals, security can be improved my making networks more resistant to lateral movement by attackers and enhancing the ability to attribute actions to individual persons.","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2015-01-22T14:51:12Z","pushed_at":"2018-01-28T03:27:07Z","updated_at":"2020-05-16T20:54:18Z","html_url":"https://github.com/trustedsec/SHIPS","clone_url":"https://github.com/trustedsec/SHIPS.git","git_url":"git://github.com/trustedsec/SHIPS.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:trustedsec/SHIPS.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/trustedsec/SHIPS","language":"JavaScript","fork":false,"forks_count":38,"open_issues_count":13,"stargazers_count":112,"watchers_count":112,"size":1605,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"archived":false,"disabled":false,"license":{"key":"other","name":"Other","spdx_id":"NOASSERTION"},"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/issues{/number}","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/keys{/key_id}","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/labels{/name}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/languages","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/merges","milestones_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/milestones{/number}","notifications_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/notifications{?since,all,participating}","pulls_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/pulls{/number}","releases_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/releases{/id}","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/stargazers","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/statuses/{sha}","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/subscription","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/tags","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/git/trees{/sha}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trustedsec/SHIPS/teams"},{"id":30884335,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDg4NDMzNQ==","owner":{"login":"JMPerez","id":416456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjQ1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/416456?v=4","html_url":"https://github.com/JMPerez","gravatar_id":"","type":"User","site_admin":false,"url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/events{/privacy}","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/following{/other_user}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/followers","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/gists{/gist_id}","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMPerez/subscriptions"},"name":"promise-throttle","full_name":"JMPerez/promise-throttle","description":"A small library to throttle promises.
