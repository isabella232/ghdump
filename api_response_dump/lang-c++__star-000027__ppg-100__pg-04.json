of the Projective Dynamics simulation method proposed by Dr. Ladislav Kavan et al. in 2014. This method of simulation projects each constraint locally and in parallel by making use of the OpenMP library, which allows the algorithm to maintain real-time performance speeds even with complex models, before solving for the system globally. This is the first publicly available implementation of this research.
