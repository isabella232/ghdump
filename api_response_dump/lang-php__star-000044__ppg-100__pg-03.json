本通用后台包含以下功能：   1、RBAC权限管理功能；  便捷地对系统中用户进行权限分配，所以权限分配可以在一个页面分配完成。     2、简单新闻发布版块；  基本的新闻发布、修改、删除。     3、无极限分类功能；  满足新闻分类等的无极限分类的功能，你可以根据实际情况修改。     4、每月自动备份功能；  管理员每个月第一次登陆后台，系统会后台自动进行当月数据备份功能。     5、备份、还原数据库，打包已备份sql文件  备份数据量大时，系统会自动分隔备份成多个sql文件，每个sql文件头部记录了当前sql文件包含了那些表数据。支持其他软件导入的sql文件导入（支持导入\u003e200M的sql文件，目前只测试过200M左右的sql文件，虽然支持但是还是不建议这么做）。     6、打包已备份sql文件，在线解压zip数据文件  考虑到节省磁盘空间，你可以将已备份是sql文件打包成zip压缩文件（对应打包的sql文件会被清除），同时你可以在线解压之间zip打包的文件（zip文件保留）。     7、邮件发送sql备份，下载数据库备份文件  在你配置了系统邮件信息后，你可以轻松将你的备份sql文件打包发送到你指定的邮箱中，如果发送的sql文件较多较大，系统考虑到备份邮箱不支持大附件系统将分成多封邮件发送（压缩前50M一封，压缩后一般在6~7M左右），同时你可以将系统备份的sql文件下载到你本地。     8、数据优化修复功能  你可以轻松优化修复你的mysql数据库。     9、缓存清除功能  你不用去一个一个目录地清除缓存文件了，只要勾选确定就可以了     10、JS\\CSS 压缩缓存  系统加入了minify压缩js、css缓存，为了和TP的分隔符分开，如果你要将你的js、css加入到minify中，你必须使用竖线“|”将多个文件分隔开。     11、后台有二维码访问图  如果你不需要请自行在/Admin/Lib/Action/CommonAction.class.php 里去掉，同时修改模板文件。
