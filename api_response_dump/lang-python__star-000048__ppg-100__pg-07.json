was my Master's project where i was involved using a dataset from Wireless Sensor Data Mining Lab (WISDM) to build a machine learning model to predict basic human activities using a smartphone accelerometer, Using Tensorflow framework, recurrent neural nets and multiple stacks of Long-short-term memory units(LSTM)  for building a deep network.  After the model was trained,  it was saved and exported to an android application and the predictions were made using the model and the interface to speak out the results using text-to-speech API.","homepage":"","default_branch":"master","created_at":"2017-09-12T21:50:03Z","pushed_at":"2017-09-25T23:14:22Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T18:43:07Z","html_url":"https://github.com/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones","clone_url":"https://github.com/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones.git","git_url":"git://github.com/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones.git","ssh_url":"git@github.com:girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones.git","svn_url":"https://github.com/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones","language":"Python","fork":false,"forks_count":31,"open_issues_count":1,"stargazers_count":49,"watchers_count":49,"size":145845,"permissions":{"admin":false,"pull":true,"push":false},"topics":["android-application","androidstudio","deep-learning","hidden-units","human-activities","lstm-neural-networks","machine-learning","pickle","proof-of-concept","pycharm-ide","python3","rnn-tensorflow","scikit-learn","smartphone-accelerometer"],"archived":false,"disabled":false,"private":false,"has_issues":true,"has_wiki":true,"has_pages":false,"has_projects":true,"has_downloads":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/{archive_format}{/ref}","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/assignees{/user}","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/git/blobs{/sha}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/branches{/branch}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/collaborators{/collaborator}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/comments{/number}","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/commits{/sha}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/compare/{base}...{head}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/contents/{+path}","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/contributors","deployments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/deployments","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/downloads","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/events","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/forks","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/git/commits{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/git/refs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/git/tags{/sha}","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/hooks","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/issues/comments{/number}","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Nets-RNN-LSTM-and-Tensorflow-on-Smartphones/issues/events{/number}","issues_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/girishp92/Human-activity-recognition-using-Recurrent-Neural-Net
